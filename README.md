# Overview
This repository contains Python code for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset is stored in an Excel file named data.xlsx.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
## Installation
Install the required dependencies using pip:
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn

## Usage
1. Ensure that the dataset file data.xlsx is placed in the same directory as the Python scripts.
2. Run the Python scripts to perform exploratory data analysis.
python data_analysis.py
3. The analysis results will be displayed in the console and saved as visualizations in the output/ directory.

## Analysis Steps
1. Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. Perform basic data exploration:
3. Display the first few rows of the dataset.
4. Check for missing values.
5. Display basic statistics of numerical columns.
6. Visualize the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn:
7. Histograms to visualize the distribution of numerical variables.
8. Box plots to compare categorical variables.
9. Scatter plots to explore relationships between variables.
10. Heatmaps to visualize correlations between numerical variables.
11. Pair plots to visualize multiple variable relationships.

## Results
1. The analysis provides insights into the distribution of numerical variables, relationships between variables, and correlations with the target variable (e.g., salary).
2. Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps are used to effectively communicate the findings.
